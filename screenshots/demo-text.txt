The down and up cursor movement of ‘j’ and ‘k’
will be familiar to nearly all Vim users. 


Similarly, many Vim users will be familiar with
the use of Ctrl-E and Ctrl-Y to scroll. Note how
the cursor remains stationary on the document.


Wheel combines the two to produce a new scrolling
cursor movement with Ctrl-J and Ctrl-K. Note how
they counter one another to maintain the cursor
screen position.


Be sure to check out the README and enjoy the
plugin!
