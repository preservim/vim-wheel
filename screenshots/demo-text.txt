This is the ‘j’ and ‘k’ cursor movement familiar
to most Vim users. Note how a scroll is forced to
keep the cursor inside the window.




This is the scrolling of Ctrl-E and Ctrl-Y. Note
how the cursor remains stationary on the document
during the scroll.




Vim-wheel combines the two to produce a new
scrolling cursor movement with Ctrl-J and Ctrl-K,
where the scroll counters the movement in the
document to maintain the cursor screen position.




Thanks for watching and enjoy the plugin!
